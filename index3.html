                    <h1>Txti has retired.</h1>
                    <p>Txti was created in 2014 with a simple and benevolent mission: to play a part in a more globally accessible internet. Our slogan was "fast web pages for everybody," and it worked! Txti served millions of people, with well over half a million fast web pages created. Since then, the whole world has changed. Now, there is less need for web pages that work on flip phones, and more need for trustworthiness and safety on the internet. As txti is not able to keep up with this need, it's time for it to step aside to ensure we're not causing harm.</p>
                    <p>Thank you to everyone who used and loved txti. It was a fun and useful project that I simply wasn't able to maintain. There are many lessons learned here, but I'm grateful to have been a part of a <a href="https://www.omegle.com/">special</a> <a href="index.html">era</a> of the internet's evolution. </p>
                    <p>Peace and love,</p>
                    <p>B</p>
